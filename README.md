# Forest Monitoring Using Hyperspectral Imagery :deciduous_tree:

## Overview :memo:

This project explores the application of hyperspectral imagery in forest monitoring, using a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to classify various land cover types such as forests, grasslands, and agricultural fields. The project leverages the Indian Pines hyperspectral dataset to develop a model that can accurately classify and analyze different environmental features, contributing to environmental management and conservation efforts.

## Abstract :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

Forests play a crucial role in global ecosystems, making their monitoring essential for environmental sustainability. This project focuses on using hyperspectral imagery combined with a hybrid 3D-2D CNN approach to perform detailed classification of land cover types. The hyperspectral data, which contains rich spectral information, is processed to distinguish between different types of vegetation, crops, and man-made structures. The model's outputs provide valuable insights into land use, helping in environmental monitoring and land management.

## Project Goals :dart:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtain and preprocess hyperspectral data from the Indian Pines dataset.
2. **Model Development:** Develop a hybrid 3D-2D CNN model to classify different land cover types using spectral and spatial features.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy and compare it against state-of-the-art methods.
4. **Visualization:** Create classification maps and statistical reports that visually represent the distribution of various land cover types.
5. **Environmental Impact:** Use the model to support environmental management and conservation efforts by providing accurate land cover classifications.

## Methodology :gear:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - Acquired hyperspectral data from the Indian Pines dataset.
   - Preprocessed the data to remove noise, correct for atmospheric effects, and align it with ground control points.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Used a 3D CNN to extract spectral-spatial features from the hyperspectral data cube.
   - Further refined the spatial features using a 2D CNN, and concatenated the outputs to form a fused feature map.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Trained the hybrid 3D-2D CNN model on the processed data.
   - Used cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer for model training.

4. **Classification and Visualization:**
   - Applied the trained model to classify land cover types in the hyperspectral images.
   - Visualized the classification results using maps, graphs, and statistical reports.

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
   - Compared the modelâ€™s performance with state-of-the-art methods to validate its effectiveness.

## Results :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- **Model Accuracy:** The hybrid 3D-2D CNN model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.4% on the Indian Pines dataset.
- **Key Findings:** The model was able to accurately classify various land cover types including forests, crops, and man-made structures. The classification map provided a detailed visualization of land use, aiding in environmental monitoring efforts.
