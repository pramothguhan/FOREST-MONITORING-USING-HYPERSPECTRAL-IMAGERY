# FOREST-MONITORING-USING-HYPERSPECTRAL-IMAGERY

This project focuses on utilizing hyperspectral imaging for forest terrain monitoring, aiming to provide detailed insights into forest contents and potential risks. It utilizes the Indian Pines dataset, which captures hyperspectral data from a forested area, and employs a hybrid classification method, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), 3D CNN, M3D-CNN, SSRN, and a Hybrid model for precise forest analysis.

The Indian Pines dataset serves as the foundational dataset, offering hyperspectral images for detailed forest element and material analysis.

The hybrid classification approach combines machine learning and deep learning techniques, capturing spectral and spatial features within hyperspectral data. This approach is achieved through multiple 3D convolution layers, a 2D convolutional layer, and dense layers in the model architecture.

The trained model provides comprehensive insights, including accurate vegetation cover percentage, building presence, and hazard detection (e.g., fires or floods). This information is invaluable for forest management and risk mitigation strategies.

In summary, this project represents a significant advancement in forest monitoring through hyperspectral imaging and hybrid classification. It equips forest managers, ecologists, and environmental researchers with essential tools for informed decisions and enhanced forest resilience.
